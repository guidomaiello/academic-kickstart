abstract: "Reticular pseudodrusen are associated with a thinner choroid. The aim of our study was to determine the differences in central choroidal thickness and choriocapillaris vascular flow area between eyes with and without reticular pseudodrusen using swept-source optical coherence tomography and swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography. We conducted a retrospective case control study which included 27 eyes from 27 consecutive patients with intermediate age-related macular degeneration and 17 eyes from 17 healthy participants. Complete ophthalmic examinations were carried out including axial length measurements; fundus color retinography; fundus autofluorescence; swept-source optical coherence tomography and swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography; central choroidal thickness and choriocapillaris vascular flow area. Patients were classified as no reticular pseudodrusen, mild reticular pseudodrusen, and severe reticular pseudodrusen. Mean central choroidal thickness in patients exhibiting severe reticular pseudodrusen (110 ± 56 μm) was significantly smaller than in patients with no reticular pseudodrusen (201 ± 76 μm, p textless 0.01). Mean choriocapillaris vascular flow area in severe reticular pseudodrusen patients (45.2% ± 3.0%) was also significantly less than in patients with no (47.9% ± 1.6%, p textless 0.001) and mild reticular pseudodrusen (47.7% ± 1.0%, p textless 0.05). Stepwise multiple regression models confirmed the association of reticular pseudodrusen with central choroidal thickness (p textless 0.001) and choriocapillaris vascular flow area (p textless 0.01) even after accounting for age, axial length, and refractive error. Soft drusen were not associated with changes in either central choroidal thickness (p = 0.13) nor choriocapillaris vascular flow area (p = 0.29). A significant, positive relationship was found between central choroidal thickness and choriocapillaris vascular flow area (r = 0.44, p = 0.01). Therefore, both central choroidal thickness and choriocapillaris vascular flow area are decreased in eyes with reticular pseudodrusen, as compared to healthy eyes and intermediate age-related macular degeneration eyes not exhibiting reticular pseudodrusen. In addition, central choroidal thickness and choriocapillaris vascular flow area are related, and the reduction of either is directly associated to the severity of reticular pseudodrusen. Further studies are needed to assess the clinical significance of these findings."
