 abstract = {Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a powerful instrument for helping clinicians detect and monitor glaucoma. The aim of this study was to provide a detailed mapping of the relationships between visual field (VF) sensitivities and measures of retinal structure provided by a commercial Spectral Domain (SD)-OCT system (RTvue-100 Optovue).},
